# Belt drive simulation

Code for a belt drive consisted of an elastic belt and two identical pulleys. For simulating the system we applied special modeling for the normal and tangential contact between pulleys and belt, while for the numerical modeling of the belt we employed an ANCF beam element. All methods are described in the documentation.

Apart from the methods applied, in the docs you can find the description of the example and the code. See .pdf file. In src you can find the python code.

For running the code:

* fufill the requirements noted in requirements.txt,

* read the example's description given in the documentation, 

* read the description of the code and follow the instructions given.
