# Belt drive simulation

Code for a belt drive consisted of an elastic belt and two identical pulleys. For simulating the system we applied special modeling for the normal and tangential contact between pulleys and belt, while for the numerical modeling of the belt we employed an ANCF beam element. 

In docs/mainFileLocal.pdf you can find the description of the belt drive simulation, a description of the code as well as installation and running instructions. In src you can find the python code.
